# Improved Prompt

Objective: Add a Context7 MCP usage rule to the CLAUDE.md file

Rule to Add:
Create a new section called "## Context7 MCP Usage" with the following instruction:

"Proactively use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date library and API documentation without requiring explicit user requests. Use Context7 automatically when:
- Working with any library, framework, or SDK (Angular, .NET, SignalR, LiveKit, etc.)
- Generating code that uses external APIs or libraries
- Setting up or configuring tools, packages, or dependencies
- Troubleshooting library-specific issues or errors
- Looking up current best practices or syntax"

Placement:
- Add after the "Important Context for Claude" section
- Before the Clavix Integration section (above the <!-- CLAVIX:START --> marker)

Technical Context:
- File: CLAUDE.md in project root
- Preserve existing content and Clavix integration
- Use consistent markdown formatting with the rest of the file

Success Criteria:
- Rule is clearly visible and actionable
- Covers all common documentation lookup scenarios
- Claude will automatically consult Context7 without prompting
